# ðŸš« Cheating & Exploits



* Using third-party software that will provide an advantage in roleplay (autoclickers, aimbot, mods in general) will result in an automatic perma-ban, with no appeal.
* Exploiting a known bug or issue, or finding a bug and not reporting it immediately will result in a power-gaming strike and temporary ban depending on the severity.
* Receiving large sums of money without reporting it will result in a wipe or ban if the other participant is found to be a cheater/hacker
* Core Life runs on an honor system. It is your responsibility to report suspicious behavior or you will be punished in the same way the offender is.
