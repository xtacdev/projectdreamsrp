# ðŸ‘©ðŸ’¼ Lawyers



* It must be known that if you are caught red-handed by a police officer, committing a crime, even if you bring a lawyer to your case, you will not escape or leave without a fine or prison time. They are there to lower time, fines, and possibly get you out without said time or fines, but only if they build a strong enough case. Lawyers nor cops can demand someone stays in jail, or leaves the jail, without all evidence being presented, and negotiations on terms from both parties.
* Lawyers are not allowed to participate in any illegal or gang activities. If you are caught doing either you will be removed from your lawyer position and blacklisted from whitelisted jobs for 2 weeks.
