# ðŸ’Š Criminal Activities



* There should be no criminal activity 15 minutes before and after a tsunami. This allows cops, EMS, and most of the general population to fly in to give all parties involved a fair chance to participate.
* Fake hostages are prohibited, you need to find a real one(s) for robberies. Gang members do not take other gang members hostage for criminal activity.
* When robbing other players, donâ€™t rob the same person more than one time in the same hour. When pocket wiping, do not take phones, food or radios. Space your robberies out within 10-15 minutes of each other, and donâ€™t rob people in unrealistic environments, such as in broad daylight or in a public space with other people around. Doing so is considered Fail RP.
* Criminals cannot demand people to take money from ATMs, or transfer ownership of vehicles, housing, or so on. You may ask for spare keys, but no ownership of vehicles. When robbing Police, you can take everything except for handcuffs and class 2+ weaponry, but you are not allowed to rob police officers for the sole purpose of taking their items. That is Fail RP and you will be punished. (<mark style="color:blue;">An example where you could rob a cop, is if a cop threw the book at you and was rude, you could then find them later on and enact your revenge.</mark>)
* You cannot commit third party robberies. Ex: A bank is being robbed, so you cannot shoot the cops, then shoot the robbers to take the money.
* Before robberies or shootings occur, both parties MUST acknowledge in some way, shape, or form, that there is a reason for the transpiring event. This can include conversation, drive-by of rival gangs, insults, trash-talking on twitter, and so on.
