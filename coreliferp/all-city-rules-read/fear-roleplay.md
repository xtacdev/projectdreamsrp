# ðŸŽ† Fear Roleplay



* <mark style="color:purple;">`Fear Roleplay:`</mark> Not valuing your life falls into this category as well. Fear roleplay is fearing for your life in situations where there are things in your environment, be it other characters, or naturally occurring obstacles such as heights. Ex: You are cornered on the roof by police, and decide to jump, that is Fail RP, and not abiding within the rules of Fear Roleplay.
* Suicide roleplay is not allowed. Cop baiting also falls under Fail RP.
