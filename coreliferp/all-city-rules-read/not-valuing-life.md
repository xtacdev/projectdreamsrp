# ðŸŽ† Not Valuing Life



* <mark style="color:purple;">`NVL:`</mark> Not Valuing your Life is something that can ruin roleplay, immersion, and depending on the severity can be borderline RDM, VDM, or Fail RP. Ex of NVL: Gang members roll up on you and tell you to empty your pockets with guns out, you then proceed to shoot them, and dont follow their commands.
* <mark style="color:purple;">`Example where retaliation is allowed: You already have a firearm out and one gang member rolls up on you, you then proceed to shoot them. If you are outnumbered by at least one other person, you must value your life and comply`</mark><mark style="color:purple;">.</mark>
* Taking 50 feet jumps to avoid altercation (also known as rat jumping) could be considered NVL in 90% of situations.
