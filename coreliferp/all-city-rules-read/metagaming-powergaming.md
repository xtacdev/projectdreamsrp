****

**Metagaming And Power gaming:**

* <mark style="color:purple;">`Meta gaming:`</mark> Using information gained from Out-of-Character sources to give your character knowledge that they might not already know, or advantages that can lead to unfair roleplay. Ex: Watching a streamer about to do a bank robbery, so you, as a cop, pre-prepare units to attend the active scene, or follow their car after cops have lost visual contact.
* <mark style="color:purple;">`Power gaming:`</mark> Using mechanics in game to give yourself an advantage **/** abusing bugs. This also includes forcing roleplay in your favor by doing things such as /me without the consent of the other party.
* <mark style="color:purple;">`Torture RP/interrogations:`</mark> Torture roleplay/interrogations by both criminals and police are allowed, but must stick within the boundaries of the city. Cops must follow their SOP when interrogating someone, and criminals must not go too overboard with physical harm. You can use /me to say youâ€™re punching them, pouring gas on their face, but you cannot do any form of humiliation or body mutilation. You can also use in game punches and weapons to hurt them/ using guns to shoot legs, wrenches to cause damage and so on. This kind of roleplay should only be tolerated if both parties consent to the situation. The roleplay must also be done in retaliation, and not just for NO reason. Any form of ERP or NSFW RP for torture will lead to an instant ban with NO APPEAL.
* You cannot watch the streams of other people while you are currently in the city.
* Use of third party VOIP to interfere with roleplay scenarios that you are not informed of in character is prohibited. Use in game radios for situations like this.
