# ðŸ¥¼ Character Building And Roleplay Interactions



* No one can decide to perma-kill your character except for you.
* No police officers are allowed to be corrupt.
* You cannot be in a gang and be a cop. You can only be in a gang and be EMS on another character.&#x20;
* You are here to roleplay, not make money, so donâ€™t powergame for money.
* Separate your characters. Each one is their own unique person with their own likes, wants, and personalities, They do NOT know each other and NEVER WILL know each other in any way shape or form. You may not EVER reference ANY of your other characters for ANY reason whatsoever. The exception is if you hear stories, in which case you are allowed to comment, and listen, but never allowed to know, meet, or see. If you are in a gang and want to become EMS you will have to get approval.&#x20;
* You cannot cross-meta information from one character to another, that falls directly under metagaming and you will get a strike and/or a ban.
* A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself if it makes sense for your character to drive this type of car, or react this type of way in this type of situation. Let your character be unique, and fun, and keep them consistent, unless there is genuine growth, in which case it needs to feel organic.
* Discipline yourself, know when to take L's, donâ€™t get toxic, and understand that things will not always go your way, but donâ€™t let that discourage you from roleplaying. Stuff happens, and everyone needs to be mature, fair, and reasonable.
* <mark style="color:purple;">`NOTE: IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU ARE A DONATOR OR NOT, SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN HERE FROM THE START, SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ADMINS, OR SOMEONE WHO PLAYS FOR FREE. EVERYONE FOLLOWS THESE EXACT RULES. NO EXCEPTIONS.`</mark>
