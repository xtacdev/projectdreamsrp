# ♾ Employee Conduct

{% hint style="info" %}
**Professionalism:** (read below)
{% endhint %}

> It is important that the Police Department personnel be professional at all times and maintain our core values. We must maintain high standards of communication at all times.
>
> At any time if you see a fellow officer doing something unbecoming of an officer or unprofessional you must report it to an higher up Officer asap. Video is needed. This applies to any officer of any department. HC will decide where to send the info.
>
> If you have a personal issue with a fellow officer, use your chain of command. They may decide to mediate the issue themselves or send the issue higher. SGT+ may decide to send the issue straight to IA and bypass command at any time. If the officer is in another department you may contact IA at your discretion.
