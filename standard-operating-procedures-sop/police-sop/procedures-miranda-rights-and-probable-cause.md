# ðŸ§¾ Procedures, Miranda Rights And Probable Cause

{% hint style="success" %}
**Protective Pat-Down:** (Must Read)
{% endhint %}

> A protective pat-down is a rudimentary search of a Subject's outer clothing for hard or sharp objects that could be used as weapons during the field interrogation. A Officer may conduct a search if he or she has reasonable suspicion to believe that the person is armed and dangerous, or suspects that the person presents a danger of attack. A protective pat-down is NOT a full search of a person's body, clothing, articles or vehicles for evidence. A protective pat-down does not require the Subject to be notified of any rights as required during a full search or arrest.&#x20;
>
> During the pat-down, if a Officer detects something that could be used as a weapon, the Officer may retrieve and retain the item during the field interrogation and must return it to the Subject provided it is not an illegal item and the subject has the proper license to carry. Should the Subject be carrying a bag or parcel of any kind, the item must NOT be searched but may be removed from the Subject during questioning â€” it must be returned at the termination of the interview and must be written in the report.

**Miranda Rights:** (Must Read)
{% endhint %}

> Miranda Rights should read correctly and in order like the following: <mark style="color:blue;">"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to seek an attorney after your release from custody. If you can not afford one, one may be appointed to you through the Los Santos Criminal of Justice Department"</mark>.

**Guidelines and Procedures:** (Must Read)
{% endhint %}

> Police are not required to give Miranda warnings when conducting on-the-scene questioning during the fact-gathering process unless a person is being arrested or detained.
>
> During field investigations, Subjects may be asked to identify themselves and provide an explanation of their actions; however, they are NOT required to do so and are able to walk away without answering any questions. Officers may not detain the Subject unless sufficient probable cause has been determined to allow for an arrest.

{% hint style="success" %}
**Detainment:** (Must Read)
{% endhint %}

> You have the ability to detain a party (in handcuffs) if you have reasonable suspicion they are a flight risk or immediate threat. If during your course of the investigation, you are unable to find physical evidence or immediate threat. If during your course of the investigation, you are unable to find physical evidence or gather witness statements to continue to detain you should unhandcuff them. See below for an example of the situation,
>
> * You detain two parties during what's reported as an altercation and you do not have evidence of a crime occurring (uncooperative parties and or parties stating nothing happened). At that point, you must un restrain the individuals. You may continue to investigate if you choose however the parties cannot be restrained (handcuffed) unless they begin to pose an immediate threat.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Reasonable Suspicion and Probable Cause:** (Must Read)
{% endhint %}

> Probable cause is necessary to detain and arrest someone; reasonable suspicion is necessary to start questioning someone.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Reasonable Suspicion:** (Must Read)
{% endhint %}

> Reasonable suspicion is a lower standard of probable cause as recognized by the United States Supreme Court Terry v Ohio. It was determined that temporary investigative detention is less of an infringement of a person's liberty than arresting him or her and placing them into custody. Therefore, the police do not need to have as much justification for stopping a person and questioning them â€”as well as conducting the previously mentioned "Protective Pat Down." Reasonable suspicion, as with probable cause, is not easily defined. The concept of reasonable suspicion requires a Officer only suspect that a person has committed or is about to commit a crime, even if the source of the suspicion is based on less-reliable sources. When stopping someone under reasonable suspicion, a Officer is only able to question a Subject, not detain them.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Probable Cause:** (Must Read)
{% endhint %}

> Probable cause, unlike reasonable suspicion, is a heightened standard that requires Officers to possess sufficient and trustworthy facts to believe that a crime has been committed. These facts can come from a number of sources but must be strong enough to be upheld in a court of law as factual evidence.
>
> Probable cause can lead to the detention and arrest of a person, and/or a thorough search of their property. Additionally, with adequate probable cause, Officer need not worry about the Exclusionary Rule, a rule that states that evidence gathered and arrests conducted in violation of a person's Constitutional rights and can be dismissed in court. Probable cause can come from four distinct sources:
>
> * Personal observations
>   * State Officers may use their training, experience, and expertise to infer probable cause from situations they observe, such as a vehicle driving slowly in high crime areas.
> * Information
>   * Officers may receive information from informants, witnesses, and other official and reliable sources such as records or bulletins.
> * Evidence
>   * Items in plain view, such as a crack pipe on the passenger seat of a vehicle.
> * Association
>   * If the police see a person with a known criminal background in a place where criminal activity normally takes place, they have probable cause.
