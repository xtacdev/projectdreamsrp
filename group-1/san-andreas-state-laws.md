## Article 1: Arson and Fire act &#x20;

\

\


* Acted willfully and maliciously
* Set fire or burned or caused to be burned
* Any structure, forest land or property\


## Article 2: Aircraft and Aviation

## Article 3: Offenses against the person act

### &#x20;Article 3.A: Aggravated Assault / Assault&#x20;

Assault is defined as an attempt to injure someone else, and in some circumstances can include threats or threatening behavior against others. One common definition would be an intentional attempt, using violence to force, injure or harm another person. Generally the main distinction between an assault and aggravated assault is that no contact is necessary for an assault, whereas an offensive or illegal contact must occur for aggravated assault.



Although the statute defining aggravated assault will vary by jurisdiction, a typical definition for aggravated assault is the intentional offensive or harmful touching of another person without their consent. Under this general definition, a aggravated assault offense requires all of the following:\


* Intentional touching
* The touching must be harmful or offensive
* No consent was given from the victim\
  \
  \


### 1.1 Kidnapping

\


The crime of kidnapping describes the act of moving another person against that person‚Äôs will. To establish the elements set out by San Andreas kidnapping laws, a prosecutor must show that the defendant used physical force to take, carry, or otherwise move the victim. Alternatively, the defendant must have persuaded the victim to move due to intimidation or fear. The victim did not voluntarily agree to the move.&#x20;

\


### 1.2 Murder



The unlawful killing of a human being deliberately by another.&#x20;



The only exception to this law is if someone breaks into your home and you fear for your life. You may still be arrested so that the peace officers can work out the full circumstances of the crime.&#x20;

\
\
\


### 1.3 Conspiracy to commit murder

\
\


### 1.2 Joyriding

Joy riding is a separate crime distinguished from auto theft. Joyriding involves taking another‚Äôs vehicle without their consent for a period of time. It is distinguished from theft by:

\


* The lack of intent to steal the vehicle permanently
* The lack of permission, although the law provides that a theft by trick can occur, taking a car for a joyride using deceit is not a crime.

\


Joyriding is another wobbler offense, but unlike auto theft it is generally prosecuted as a misdemeanor.&#x20;

\
\

\
\


### 1.2 Base Jumping

\


This activity is legal in isolated areas and with a dedicated instructor. It is illegal however to base jump within the city limits or any built up area which may result in a large-scale disturbance or endangering the wider public. &#x20;

\
\


### 1.3 Burglary

\


To enter a property without permission and intend to commit a crime after entering the property. The San Andreas penal code lists the types of properties which an individual might enter while committing a burglary. These types of premises include houses, apartments, residential rooms and businesses. More uncommon types of property such as tents, outhouses and others also qualify.

\
\
\
\


### 1.4 Trespassing

\


Most people have heard the term ‚Äútrespassing‚Äù and understand its basic meaning-- to enter another‚Äôs property without their permission. But legally speaking, there must also be some level of intent. Simply wandering onto someone‚Äôs property is not itself a crime or a civil wrongdoing. But scaling a fence or disregarding a ‚Äúno trespassing‚Äù sign does adequately show intent. trespassing charges often involve wrongful acts (or the intent to commit them), such as burglary, vandalism, or invasion of privacy.  &#x20;

\
\


### 1.5 Dirty Money / Money Laundering

\


If you are found with any dirty money on you no matter what your excuse is or where it has come from it will be removed and destroyed. It is also at the discretion of the officer whether they fine you or send you to jail for money laundering.&#x20;

\


Money laundering is the illegal act of exchanging dirty money for clean money while charging a fee or any other gain for doing so. If you exchange dirty money for free you are still committing the offense of money laundering.&#x20;

\


### 1.6 Disturbing the peace

\


San Andreas law provides three definitions of disturbing the peace that prosecutors may use to pursue criminal charges against the defendant. First, a prosecutor may try to show that a defendant engaged in a fight in a public place or challenged another person to a fight in a public place.&#x20;

\


The prosecutor does not need to prove the defendant actually intended for the fight to happen -- simply issuing the challenge for a fight may be enough for a criminal charge. San Andreas disturbing the peace laws fall under the broader category of disorderly conduct.&#x20;

\


#### Loud and unreasonable noise

\


A prosecutor can also establish disturbing the peace by showing a defendant's ‚Äúmalicious or willful disturbance‚Äù of another person through ‚Äúloud and unreasonable noise‚Äù. Willfulness refers to the defendant‚Äôs purpose or intent when making loud noises to disturb another person‚Äôs peace and quiet. A prosecutor can also charge disturbing the peace based on a disturbance affecting an entire neighborhood. &#x20;

\
\


#### Offensive words

\


In addition, a prosecutor can charge disturbing the peace based on a defendant‚Äôs use of ‚Äúoffensive words‚Äù in a public place where use of those words is ‚Äúinherently likely‚Äù to result in a violent reaction. San Andreas state court decisions require a review of the context where the defendant spoke the offensive words. In order to qualify as disturbing the peace, the prosecutor must show a ‚Äúclear and present danger‚Äù that violence would result from the offensive words.

\


### 1.7 Dispersal order

\


A dispersal order is issued by a member of the command team at the request of any officer. A dispersal order will last for a specified period of time within a specified area of the city. When an order is in place all citizens must adhere to the order and the specified area becomes a safe zone, so no killings or hostile RP. If ordered by any officer to leave the area when one is in place you must do so, if you refuse it is an arrestable offense. Any officer can request an order from a member of the command team however only the command team can issue the order. Members of the public will be made aware by an official announcement by the police department.&#x20;

### 1.8 Obstructing Emergency employees&#x20;

\


### 1.9 Resisting Arrest&#x20;

\


Suspects resisting arrest or failing to comply with an Peace Officer‚Äôs lawful commands.&#x20;

\


In San Andreas, there are actually two separate crimes that relate to resisting an officer. First there is the misdemeanor offense of resisting a lawful arrest. In order to be guilty of this crime, a person must have willfully resisted, delayed or otherwise obstructed a law enforcement officer or emergency medical technician while performing or attempting to perform their duties.&#x20;

\


In order to be guilty of the felony crime of resisting an officer, the person must have willfully and unlawfully attempted by threats or violence to deter or prevent an officer from performing a lawful duty, and used force or violence to resist an officer in the performance of their lawful duties. &#x20;

### &#x20;&#x20;

### 2.0 Disobeying Lawful order

\


It is an offense to disobey a lawful order given by a sworn officer of San Andreas. A lawful order is defined as -&#x20;

An instruction given in order to prevent harm and further criminal offenses, protect property and preserve evidence, in the event an officer identifies there is likely to be one of the above breached then a lawful order can be given. An officer must give at least one warning prior to using force to carry out the order.&#x20;

\


### 2.1 Terroristic threats&#x20;

\

\


You are allowed to cultivate 3 marijuana plants for personal use, any more than that will be deemed as mass cultivation and you will be arrested.&#x20;

\


Marijuana can be carried on a person for legal personal use only, the amount which can be held is 5 joints at any one time. More than this would not be classed as personal use and more intent to supply.&#x20;

This if proven will be an unlimited fine at the discretion of the officers based on what has been found and what intelligence has been gathered.&#x20;

\


### 1.2 Drug distribution&#x20;

\


San Andreas drug distribution laws broadly described the sale, transport, transfer and import of controlled substances.&#x20;

\


The prosecutor may try to establish the state‚Äôs case by introducing the evidence of drug sales and distribution. This evidence might include the amount of drugs attributed to the defendant and items such as packaging materials, scales, weapons, and other paraphernalia that may show possession for sale rather than personal use.&#x20;

\


### 1.3 Drug possession

\


San Andreas state laws include two broad categories for crimes of drug possession; simple possession and possession with intent to sell.&#x20;

\


Simple possession is within the legal amount set by the state, while possession with intent to sell would be going about the legal limit to distribute to others for the purpose of profit.&#x20;

\


### 1.4 Drug Paraphernalia

\


Although many items are legal to carry, when it comes to items in connection with drug manufacturing, it is at the discretion of the Peace Officer to determine if the items as a whole come into the category of Drug paraphernalia. For example it is legal to carry drug scales. But if you were found in possession of drug scales, zip lock bags, fertilizer, acetone, hydrochloride, chemistry set, rolling papers, pure water and so forth then it would be classed as drug paraphernalia and therefore illegal. &#x20;

\


## Article 9: Weapons and Firearms act&#x20;

A **stand-your-ground law** (sometimes called "**line in the sand**" or **"no duty to retreat" law**) provides that people may use deadly force when they reasonably believe it to be necessary to defend against certain violent crimes (right of self-defense). Under such a law, people have no duty to retreat before using deadly force in self-defense, so long as they are in a place where they are lawfully present. The exact details vary by jurisdiction.

The alternative to stand your ground is "duty to retreat". In jurisdictions that implement a duty to retreat, even a person who is unlawfully attacked (or who is defending someone who is unlawfully attacked) may not use deadly force if it is possible to instead avoid the danger with complete safety by retreating.
