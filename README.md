# ♾ City Rules \[Read]

**Read Carefully:**

* Your character name cannot resemble your real life name nor your discord name. Please have mature and realistic names for your characters.
* Derogatory vocabulary is prohibited. This includes substitute words for offensive terms, including but not limited to words such as, “Retard.”
* Respect is a must. Treat others how you would like to be treated.
* Immersion breaking words are not allowed, this is included but not limited to: spammed, scuffed, falling through the world, bugged, IRL, and other such words that would equivalate the city into a video game, as this is roleplay, this is your character’s “real” world, and should be treated as such.
* Mechanics cannot powergame their mechanic perms to repair vehicles while being chased by police or doing other active crimes.
* Going OOC in any form will result in a punishment.
* _<mark style="color:red;">`No killing EMS or stealing EMS vehicles. (This will result in a ban)`</mark>_
* <mark style="color:blue;">`No stealing cop cars unless it's involved in a RP situation that you have the right to take it.`</mark>
* `No killing cops unless you REALLY have to! (`<mark style="color:yellow;">`Example: your at war with another gang and the cops come and intervene by firing, you have the right to fire back`</mark>`)`

**Communication/OOC/IC Rules And Regulations:**

* Stay within character at all times – We wish to provide the best roleplay experience for everyone, and the best way to do that is through keeping the immersion alive. Under no circumstances, unless explicitly told by an admin that the situation is now OOC, should you EVER break character on your own terms. If you wish to discuss topics OOC with people, please use the appropriate methods of doing so **** through DMs in discord.
* Under no circumstance should you bring in-character drama OOC, whether it be in DMs or general chat of our discord, you will get a flag for metagaming and an OOC strike for doing so. This is to prevent drama, metagaming, and toxicity from spreading into personal lives, emotions, and relations.
* Voice changers are 100% allowed, but please make them good quality, unless the intention is to sound bad, such as making yourself sound like a robot to disguise your identity.
* Everything that happens in character is done with the intent of how that character is, and should never be a stamp on the persons real life personality. People who are nice in the real world, will sometimes play rude or hard/toughened characters in the game. All in character insults and beef must be retaliated and settled within the city’s borders.
* As stated in the General Rules, there should be NO immersion breaking words like cousins, neighbors, bugged, grinding, and so on. This insinuates that you are in a video game, and good role players, who take the hobby and server seriously, will probably get annoyed and are likely to lose immersion from such words. Do not apologize if you slip up, but instead correct yourself or move past the comment as soon as possible
* You cannot use any clips, videos, or screenshots in the court of law, without having a visible GoPro or bodycam on your person or an article of clothing. Police cars and other vehicles DO NOT HAVE DASHBOARD FOOTAGE, as it is difficult to determine what the dashcam would actually see, since we will always see the POV from the officer or person in question. You cannot review your bodycam footage after going down as you are supposed to follow NLR. It is assumed your footage is corrupted on going down. A bodycam is not needed if there is a blatant rule break, this is only for court cases or police disputes.
* You can use /report to talk to an admin or staff member, for being stuck, bugs, or anonymous reports of suspected hackers and so on.
