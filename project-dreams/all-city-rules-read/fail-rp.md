# ðŸŽ† Fail RP

* <mark style="color:purple;">`Fail RP:`</mark> Failure to roleplay a situation or scenario realistically, however there are exceptions depending on the scenario. Overall try to have actions and reactions fit within the realm of realism. Sitting outside of the hospital for no reason can be deemed as Fail RP for lack of roleplay or contribution.
* Consistently taking friends hostage and pretending that they are real could be considered Fail RP.
