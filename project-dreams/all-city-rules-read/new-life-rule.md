# üíü New Life Rule



* <mark style="color:purple;">`NLR:`</mark> When you go down and are transported to the hospital, you must not return to the scene you were just at for 15 minutes. If you are a cop, you are to take a 10-15 minute break in VPD (unless there are less than 3 cops in the city) from the time you arrive there, and even after that break, you are not allowed back to that active scene to respond, or retaliate. You are required to forget the last 15 minutes of when you go down, regardless of if you ‚Äúbled-out.‚Äù
* You cannot talk about your 'near death experience' after you have received medical treatment, until you find out what happened from others that were involved.
* No matter where you shoot someone, it is always assumed you shot them in the body, or limbs. The victim of the damages is allowed to decide where they were injured for roleplaying with EMS through /me. EMS are not allowed to assume damages or injuries done to the individual. No matter where you are shot, you are supposed to forget the situation if you bleed out. If you are shot but are still conscious then you may be able to cry for help and remember the situation as long as you don't bleed out.
* You must be organically told about what happened from someone in that situation with you, otherwise you must roleplay to find out for yourself. You must be honest with EMS about any/all injuries. If you were shot, you were shot.
* Combat reviving is prohibited for EMS, and PD, and even staff members are not allowed to revive people on scene unless they deem it is necessary through RDM or VDM. That is the only exception to this rule. Otherwise you must always be transported to the hospital, regardless if you're a Cop, EMT or Criminal. Everyone is treated as equal. If you are still conscious and can receive medical on scene through an EMT, then you may request bandages, medicine, etc.
