# ðŸš· RDM / VDM



* <mark style="color:purple;">`RDM:`</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark> Random Deathmatch is prohibited. Ex: Shooting somebody for no reason and killing them with no interaction.
* <mark style="color:purple;">`VDM:`</mark> Vehicular Deathmatch is prohibited. Ex: Running someone over with no roleplay. (Car ramming doesn't necessarily count as VDM in some situations, but is frowned upon unless needed.)
