# ⚔ Gang Rules



* <mark style="color:purple;">`Initiation:`</mark> Initiation is required to engage in any combat with another player. When initiating, you must make the player aware of your intent. To initiate you must be AT LEAST within shout voice range and must allow the other person to respond to your roleplay with words or actions. A player may not be engaged if she/he is in a menu or (IN THEIR HEAD).
* Killing someone must be carried out with High Quality Roleplay, “put your hands up or I will shoot” etc is considered Fail RP and may lead to a ban for RDM/Fail RP. Executing another player must also be carried out with high quality roleplay, the only exception to this rule is if both you and the victim are engaged in a gunfight together.
* <mark style="color:purple;">`Retaliation:`</mark> During the Attack / Retaliate process the attacker can only attack again once the defender has retaliated. If the defending Gang fails to retaliate within three days, then the War is over with the Attacker being declared the victor.
* <mark style="color:purple;">`Kill Timer:`</mark> After any gang fight/war you must wait 30 minutes before initiating again.
* You cannot sneak up on territories to “surprise attack” that is borderline RDM and not fair, as there is no engagement until they are dead. Drive-By shootings are only acceptable for gang wars if both gangs agree on (<mark style="color:purple;">kill on sight</mark>).&#x20;
* There is a 12 person limit to gang sizes, unless you get the green light to have more. After the greenlight, you can have 25. If you wish for your gang to be whitelisted (Benefits: x1 Gang MLO, Territory marker/blip, Free Custom Clothing & 1 free business.) you must apply. The leader is responsible for all of its members’ actions.
