# Declaring/Concluding Gang Wars and Allies

Something crucial within RP must happen between the two parties in order for a war to happen. A poor reason behind a war can lead to admin intervention.

Wars must be declared in a face to face meeting between the leaders and rosters are to be kept up to date with who you are at war with. Gang Wars must be concluded in the same fashion, face to face. In most cases the request for peace should be accepted, unless there is a very good reason to push for more war. The declaration scene and the first attack must be separate scenes.

Both sides may introduce 1 ally to join in on the war only if they are down by a 2 to 1 ratio on gang members ex = 12 gang members vs 6 (the gang of 6 would be allowed to go get backup)

Allies must be made known during the War Declaration and follow the same rules as the primary group. If allies are brought in, it can only be one other gang not multiple members from other gangs. Each side may only have one group allied with them at any one time to keep numbers limited. Please ensure that you are keeping your roster up-to-date with who your ally is and who you are at war with.
